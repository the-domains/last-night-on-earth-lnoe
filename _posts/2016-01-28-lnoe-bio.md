> On the 12th of April 2016 **Last Night On Earth** (LNOE) releases their debut EP. Written, recorded, produced and mixed by **LNOE **and friends, it is truly a product of a vision undimmed by the usual commercial aspects. This IS _Last Night On Earth_.  
> 
> "We call it **Tiger Heart** as it condenses what it takes to live through times of extreme _emotional states_ and an everyday life out of control" LNOE says. "Tiger Heart takes you through ecstatic nights where you only live for the moment and don't think about the consequences of your actions, to grey, sober days, to lonely nights in bed when the walls seems to shrink in and you count the failing years and the shortcoming of your once beautiful dreams"
> 
> A life out of control. A looming shadow in the back of your head. An unrest. But no way out.
> 
> **Sleeping Pills**- Sleeping pills may, for some, be what it takes to escape a world shaking in its foundations under toxic skies. It may be, for others, a metaphor for what happens when you truly connect to someone, leaving a darkening world to slip into a beautiful dream you share.
> 
> **If I die Tonight I Want You To Know**- Drum beats and neon glow. You do not know where the night and your actions will take you. A life out of control changes many thoughts. If there is something to hold on to, like a rock in a foaming sea, its the thought of you. And if I die tonight I just want you to know.
> 
> **Urbanomania**- Trapped in patterns you can't escape. The highs and lows of an excessive urban lifestyle played out while the years pass by. Life is just a dream.
> 
> **Manphetamine**- "In resent years thereÂ´s been an ever increasing debate over gender inequality. Still, in times of social media, many of those who are most outspoken about this, are still trapped in the same patterns that keep inequality where it is. You want equality but still you turn yourself into an object just to get high on verification, and so you feed the structures you say you oppose"
> 
> **Everything Hurts When You Sleep In Her Bed**- Highly personal but also general. When the foundations of your world is shaking, when you have a head full of broken dreams, when the curtains are closing. When you unwillingly lose someone. It may feel like the last night on earth.

> **Malin**and**Albin**, the core of the band, met a year before the release through a mutual friend and immediately started creating what turned out to be**Tiger Heart**, after realizing they shared visions and goals. Albin had previously been touring with other artists and bands while writing music on the side for personal reasons.
> 
> Malin, the fragile and silvery, but still powerful, voice of LNOE had been singing with other artists while looking for a situation to let her own ideas flower. "It was a natural step to start what we now call LNOE when we met" Malin says.
